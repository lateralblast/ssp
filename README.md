SSP: Sun System Pictures
------------------------

A collection of Sun system pictures (new and old) from the system handbook.

SSP is named after the management nodes (the [System Service Processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Service_Processor)s),
that were used to manage the [E10K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Enterprise#Enterprise_10000).

This is designed to be used to with [Parsec](https://github.com/lateralblast/parsec).
